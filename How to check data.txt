After entering the data from the front-end application interface, how do you test whether a database in updated or not?
Ans: It is totally depends on the application interface that you are using. These are some following ways,

    You can verify only from the front-end when application interface shows view functionality of the data you enter. Mainly, Black box test engineers do this functionality verification test in this way.
    If application interface doesn’t provide view functionality of the data you enter, then you can check for database update by using relevant SQL/Oracle query.
    Checkpoint function of WinRunner/QTP can also be used to check for database update.


with as table_name(
select * row_num(),over(PARTITION by ID,Order By Id)as row_num)
delete from table_name where row_num> 1;

select * from table where 8=(select count(distnct sal)from table) where e.colum>=e.colum
